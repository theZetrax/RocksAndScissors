# RocksAndScissors
A simple Rock and Scissors game.

I Used .Net's WPF to use some simple animations and some additional features.

This is a simple project just to get me through making games.
This game doesn't feature gameloop, just because it doesn't need it.
But future versions might add it.

Drop by and Add your own flavor.

Note: There are some missing feature's I'll be working on.
      Like, Saving game session and history.
      I'll add them in future editions.
